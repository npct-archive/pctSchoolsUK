## Previous findings from literature

- Increased levels of physical activity can improve student learning [@shephard_required_1984;@sallis_effects_1999]
- Cycling can account for around half of school commutes in cycling friendly cities [@bere_longitudinal_2011]
- Strong evidence that segregated infrastructure along major school commute corridors can boost local cycling rates [@boarnet_evaluation_2005;@mcdonald_impact_2014]
- In the US $\sim 40\%$ of students walked or cycled to school in 1969, $\sim 13\%$ by 2001 [@mcdonald_active_2007]
- In the UK walking to school dropped $\sim 20\%$ points in a similar period (1970 to 1991) [@tudor-locke_active_2012]
- UK baseline: 46\% of 5-10 year-olds and 38\% of 11-16 year-olds walking
    - Walking dominates under 1 mile, car/bus 2+ miles [@department_for_transport_national_2014]
    
## School commuting and health

- Regular exercise has multiple, mutually reinforcing benefits
- US child/youth obesity rates have reached 17\% [@fryar_prevalence_2012;@karnik_childhood_2012]
- 10–30% obesity rates in the EU [@ben-sefer_childhood_2009]
- 60 minutes of daily moderate to vigorous physical activity recommended [@janssen_systematic_2010;@strong_evidence_2005]
- Part of the NHS Physical Activity Guidelines for Children and Young People [@n.h.s._physical_2016]
- But (maybe people here know of more studies) *more research needed*

## Distribution of schools

```

## Comparison of cycling to work and cycling to school

```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
if(!file.exists("paper/figures/pcycle_schools.png") | !file.exists("paper/figures/pcycle_work.png")){
  pcycle_schools = qtm(lads_active, fill = "Cycle")
  save_tmap(pcycle_schools, "paper/figures/pcycle_schools.png")
  #system("gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/screen -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=paper/figures/pcycle_schools_reduced.pdf paper/figures/pcycle_schools.pdf")

  #plot(schoolvswork$Cycle, schoolvswork$pcycle, xlab="Cycling commutes to school (%)", ylab="Cycling commutes to work (%)")
}
```

```{r pcycleschools, echo=FALSE, out.width="49%", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="The observed cycling prevalence fractions for school commutes, and for work commutes (the latter were obtained from the 2011 Census).", fig.align='center', eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figures/pcycle_schools.png", "figures/pcycle_work.png"))
```

## Walking and cycling results

```{r activeChor, echo=FALSE, out.width="49%", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Choropleth showing the prevalence of walking (left) and cycling (right) as a fraction of total commuting for school commutes in England.", fig.align='center', eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/active_choropleth.png")
```

## Modelling

$$
P(y_i = 1) = \mathrm{logit}^{-1} \left( \beta_1 d_i + \beta_2 d_i^{1/2} + \beta_3 d_i^2 + \beta_4 g_i + \beta_5 d_i g_i \right)
$$

## Model fit for UK data (distance)

```{r modeldistance, echo=FALSE, out.width="49%", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="The modelled vs observed cycling percentages, as a function of distance.", fig.align='center', eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figures/data_model_distance.png", "figures/data_model_scatter_distance.png"))
```

## Model fit for UK data (gradient)

```{r modelgradient, echo=FALSE, out.width="49%", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="The modelled vs observed cycling percentages, as a function of gradient.", fig.align='center', eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figures/data_model_gradient.png", "figures/data_model_scatter_gradient.png"))
```

## Uptake Scenarios (distance)

```{r uptakedistanceplot, echo=FALSE, out.width="49%", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="The cycling percentages observed, modelled, and projected under the Government Target and Go Dutch scenarios, as a function of distance.", fig.align='center', eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/uptake_distance.png")
```

## Uptake Scenarios (gradient)

```{r uptakegradientplot, echo=FALSE, out.width="49%", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="The cycling percentages observed, modelled, and projected under the Government Target and Go Dutch scenarios, as a function of gradient.", fig.align='center', eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/uptake_gradient.png")
```

## Headline figures

- For trips < 15km (90%+ school commutes), the current percentage of children cycling to school in England is 2.7%.

- Scenarios show the scale of transformation possible in school travel patterns: 'Going Dutch' would see over two-thirds of these children cycle to school, approaching the level observed in The Netherlands.

- Higher than the 27% cycle mode share in an equivalent 'Go Dutch' scenario for cycling to work

## Desire line level results

```{r flowsEngland, echo=FALSE, out.width="49%", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="The desire-line level school commuting flows between LSOA centroids and Secondary schools in England.", fig.align='center', eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/flowsEngland.png")
```

## Discussion

- Add primary schools
- Estimate environmental/economic benefits?
- System boundaries
